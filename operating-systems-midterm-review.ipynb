    "          - Users (Ease of Use)\n",

    "###### Operation\n",
    "      When a program in firmware exectues, it intializes aspects of the system, and loads the OS into emmory, the \n",
    "      OS will execute the first process and waits for the event to happen (Essentially in a while loop)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Events will typically be signaled by an interrupt. [Hardware and software]\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Why Interrupts?\n",
    "      \n",
    "      * To keep the CPU as busy as possible\n",
    "      * Also to improve CPU Utilization due to I/O devices being much slower than the CPU\n",

    "         * Version Control\n",

    "      * API's provide a set of functions (Parameters + Return Values) that are available to the programmer.\n",
    "      * System Calls are involved within the API.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      There are 7 types of syscalls, they go as follows:\n",
    "      1. Proces Management (execute, terminate, fork, kill)\n",
    "      2. File Manupulation (open, delete, read, close, create, write)\n",
    "      3. Device Manipulation (read, power, unmount, write, mount)\n",
    "      4. Information Maintaince (get, set, time | date)\n",
    "      5. Communication (send, recieve, read, write, socket)\n",
    "      6. Protecion (chmod, user group ids)\n",
    "      7. Memory Management (malloc, mmap and munmap)\n",
