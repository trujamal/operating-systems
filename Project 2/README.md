CS4328 Project 2

## Installation
We recommend you clone the repo for easiest implementation:

```
git clone https://github.com/trujamal/operating-systems.git
```

Navigate to the Project 2 folder within the repository

How to run the file os_project_2.cpp:
    1. On a Linux command line, run the following command  
    
```
gcc os_project_2.cpp -lpthread
```

    2. Once that is proccessed then run the next following command
    
```
    ./a.out 1
```

#### Detailed 
    1. Open an instance of the Linux command line
    2. Change to the directory that contains the file pr2_scb.cpp
    3. Type the following on the command line: gcc pr2_scb.cpp -lpthread 
    4. Press 'Enter' 
        * the program will compile and produce a new file in the directory
        * the new file will be called a.out 
    5. Type the following on the command line: ./a.out #
        * where # is a non-negative integer value 
        * the value will be used to seed rand() to produce a random card deck
        * Example 1: ./a.out 123
        * Example 2: ./a.out 5
        * (note: if you do not provide an integer, the program will use 0 by default)
    6. Press 'Enter'
        * the program will run
        * results will print to the console
        * a log file called 'log.txt' will appear in the directory


## Usage

Check the section above regarding the different conditions of the command line arguments.

### Setup Keys
The only required setup keys are just regarding compiling the code using the gcc compiler, if for any reason you don't have that compiler click [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html)


### Use the whole directory as needed
If you find a better solution to what we have created weather in C++, or python, or even java create a pull request and we will add it to the repository, to keep expanding this concenpt known as the Sauce.
